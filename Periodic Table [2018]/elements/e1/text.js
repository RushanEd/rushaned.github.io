<h1 id="para1">Introduction</h1>
<p>Hydrogen is commonly known as a gas and the first element of that table (periodic table). In fact, it is a gas and takes the first place in the periodic table. But there are some interesting facts about hydrogen. Let's put few of them here.</p>
<ul>
     <li>75% of the cosmos,75% of the Sun, 11% of the oceans and 10% of the human body consists of hydrogen. </li>
     <li>Hydrogen is the lightest element as we know today.</li>
     <li>It is highly inflammable (extremely reactive). So, in some occations we use it as a fuel.</li>
     <li>The only reason why engineers don't use hydrogen to power up vehicles, is that hydrogen is <i><b>too much powerful.</b> </i> </li>
     <li>The byproduct of hydrogen fuel is, pure water (H<sub>2</sub>O). (Simply fire hydrogen to see water pouring out from the flame. And <b><i>don't drink it.</i></b> )</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="para2">Discovery</h1>
<p><ind></ind>Hydrogen was discovered by Henry Cavendish in 1766. However the name, hydrogen was put by Antoine Lavoisier. The meaning of hydrogen is, <b>water creator</b> (<i>hydro-water,genes-creator</i>). The name that Cavendish put was "inflammable Air". Anyway, after the discovery of hydrogen, Lavoisier was more curious about this new element. He was a one who found many facts about hydrogen. </p>
<p>There is also a solid hydrogen. James Dewer took the credit for making solid hydrogen first in 1898.</p>
<h1 id="para3">Properties</h1>
<p><ind></ind>Hydrogen is a gas and a nonmetal in room temperature. It's also the lightest element in the periodic table. That's why it has taken the first place in it. Hydrogen has no color. It's transparent. As you may already know, it is inflammable. The byproduct of the hydrogen flame is, pure water.</p>
<div class="chem">
     2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> <arrow></arrow> 2H<sub>2</sub>O
</div>
<p>If you cooler hydrogen more than -260 'C, it will be a solid (which is impossible to do) and if you make it hotter more than -253 'C (more like cooler), it will be a gas. </p>
<p>Hydrogen's atomic weight is 1.007. It's element category is nonmetal. You can get a full pack of information about hydrogen from HolyTable. </p>
<p>Chemical Properties</p>
<p>Hydrogen is represented by the symbol, H. Water contains hydrogen and oxygen. Hence, the chemical thing of water is,</p>
<div class="chem">
     H<sub>2</sub>O
</div>
<p>Not only in water, hydrogen is everywhere. The human body contains 10% of hydrogen (70% of body consists water though). The universe consists hydrogen on 75%. Carbohydrates, Proteins, Lipids and Neucleic acids are the 4 main compounds of the life. And all of them contains, Hydrogen.  </p>
<h1 id="para4">Usage</h1>
<p>There are many uses.</p>
<ul>
     <li>as a rocket fuel</li>
     <li>to create Margarines</li>
     <li>to fill air baloons (not used today due to it's high reactivity)</li>
     <li>Petrolium and Diesel consists of hydrogen and carbon. Hence, they are called <i>Hydrocarbons</i>. </li>
     <li>to create Ammonia (which is a fuel)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Industrial</h1>
<p>There are severel ways to make hydrogen as a gas.</p>
<ol>
     <li>Mixing Sulfuric(H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) acid with Zinc(Zn) or Magnesium(Mg). </li>
     <li>Electrolyting water(H<sub>2</sub>O).</li>
     <li>Mixing ashes(C) with lemon juice(Citric acid) </li>
</ol>
<p>If you're going to make hydrogen immensely, you should check out these facts. </p>
<ul>
     <li>Hydrogen is everywhere. So, you can find it easily, but not as hydrogen. You have to seperate hydrogen from another compound.  </li>
     <li>Hydrogen's weight is too low. It floats on the atmosphere. So, when storing hydrogen, it should be the opposite of how we store water. A jar is required. </li>
</ul>
<h1>Warnings</h1>
<ul>
     <li>Hydrogen is highly inflammable. It burns at <dta class="e_gasIn">59 'C</dta>. And it's explosive. That's why vehicles don't run from hydrogen. </li>
     <li>The water created when hydrogen is firing, is not good for drinking. It's pure water and pure water is poisonous.  </li>
</ul>
